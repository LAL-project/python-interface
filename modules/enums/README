THIS FOLDER
===========

This folder contains the enumerations of the library wrapped so that they can be imported as classes.

In other words, we want to prevent the values in the enumerations from becoming integer variables inside a module, like this:

	lal.graphs.tree_type_caterpillar

or

	lal.graphs.caterpillar

What we want is:

	lal.graphs.tree_type.caterpillar

RENAMING ENUMERATIONS
=====================

Wrapping the enumerations into their own modules is not enough, since what we get are things like this:

	lal.graphs.tree_type.tree_type_caterpillar
	
In this folder there is a "script" that renames the enumeration's values in such a way that we get what we want

	lal.graphs.tree_type.caterpillar
