r"""
The features that can be computed in automatic processing of treebanks.

Classes ``lal.io.treebank_collection_processor`` and ``lal.io.treebank_processor`` are designed to process treebanks in an automatic fashion, meaning that they process the trees and calculate a fixed set of features, the results of which are stored in files. In this enumeration users will find a complete list of all the features that can be calculated using those two classes.

Users will find the feature values after every bullet marker.

Types of structures
-----------

- ``tree_type` The type of tree. This feature spans as many columns as types of trees are available in this library. Each column will contain either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether or not the tree can be classified into that type of tree. See ``lal.graphs.tree_type`` for a complete list of tree types.
- ``syntactic_dependency_structure_class` The type of syntactic dependency structure. This feature spans as many columns as types of syntactic dependency structure are available in this library. Each column will contain either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether or not the tree can be classified into that syntactic dependency structure. See ``lal.linarr.syntactic_dependency_structure_class`` for a complete list of types.
